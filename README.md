## Overview

NFT Tip Bot is an off-chain tipping for Discord. Tipping is off-chain and instantly. Each user needs to verify their address before they deposit gas or NFT to Bot's wallet and Bot will credit gas or NFTs to them.

Join Art101's Discord to see it in action. The bot is public and anyone can invite it to their Discord Guild. Bot's [invite link](https://verify.art101.io/invite_nftip/)

If you want to list your NFT (on Ethereum or Polygon) in this Tip Bot, please open an issue and fill in the necessary information for our integration.
